The Jolly Good Reference Frontend
---------------------------------
The Jolly Good Reference Frontend is the simplest possible frontend for The
Jolly Good API.

This repository lives at https://gitlab.com/jgemu/jgrf

Compiling
---------
Make sure you have The Jolly Good API's header files installed. If you did
not install them, you will be required to include their path in CFLAGS.

You will also require pkgconf/pkg-config, and development packages for SDL2,
SpeexDSP, and libepoxy.

Linux:
  make

macOS:
  make

BSD:
  gmake

Windows (MSYS2):
  make

The build will output an executable named "jollygood".
The program may be run locally, or installed system-wide using the "install"
target. For command line usage instructions, execute the binary with no
arguments or the -h switch.

Configuration
-------------
Configuration files are located in:
  ~/.config/jollygood

The following filenames are used:
  settings.ini           - General settings
  input_sysname.ini      - Input definitions for a specific system
  corename.ini           - Core-specific overrides to general settings
                         - Emulator settings listed in [corename] section

User data is located in:
  ~/.local/share/jollygood

The User data directory contains the following subdirectories:
  assets/corename/       - User assets such as sample data for Nestopia JG
  bios/                  - Directory the frontend will load BIOS images from
  save/corename/         - SRAM, Memory Card, or other types of save data
  screenshots/           - Screenshots with a timestamp and random number
  state/corename/        - Save States

Cores may be used locally by placing their build output directories into a
"cores/" directory created in the jgrf source directory:
mkdir cores
cp -r /path/to/core cores/

Cores that exist locally will be preferred over cores installed system-wide.

Input for games is not preconfigured. To configure a device:
  SHIFT+ALT+[Port Number] ex. SHIFT+ALT+1, SHIFT+ALT+2

Effort has been made to ensure emulator cores know what devices must be plugged
in. Console output will indicate which emulated device is plugged into which
emulated port.

Axis and Button input is considered separate. Digital buttons cannot be
assigned to emulated axes. This is a design choice. Use the ESC key to skip
defining axes if you do not have a physical input devices with axes. Ideally,
buy a budget USB gamepad with analog sticks/triggers if you want to play games
that require analog input. The reverse, assigning physical axes to emulated
digital buttons, is possible.

Force Feedback data is sent to the physical device that handles the emulated
device's axis definitions. Currently, this only exists in PlayStation and Game
Boy games. In the case of the Game Boy, there is only a single controller, so
force feedback data is sent to this controller.

Settings
--------
Below is an example of the General Settings configuration file, with defaults:

[video]
; 0 = OpenGL Core Profile, 1 = OpenGL Compatibility Profile
api = 0

;N = Scale video output by N
scale = 3

;0 = Nearest Neighbour, 1 = Linear, 2 = Sharp Bilinear, 3 = AANN,
;4 = CRT-Bespoke, 5 = CRTea, 6 = LCD
shader = 3

; Settings for CRTea
;0 = Scanlines, 1 = Aperture Grille Lite, 2 = Aperture Grille,
;3 = Shadow Mask, 4 = Custom
crtea_mode = 2

; Settings for CRTea Custom Mode
;0 = Scanlines, 1 = Aperture Grille Lite, 2 = Aperture Grille, 3 = Shadow Mask
crtea_masktype = 2

;N = Mask Strength
crtea_maskstr = 5

;N = Scanline Strength
crtea_scantr = 6

;N = Sharpness
crtea_sharpness = 7

;N = CRT Screen Curve Strength
crtea_curve = 2

;N = CRT Corner Size
crtea_corner = 3

;N = Trinitron Curve Strength
crtea_tcurve = 10

[audio]
;N = Resampler Quality (0-10)
rsqual = 3

[misc]
;0 = Debug, 1 = Info, 2 = Warning, 3 = Error
corelog = 1

;0 = Debug, 1 = Info, 2 = Warning, 3 = Error
frontendlog = 1

The above configuration settings may be overridden in a core specific
configuration file. Additionally, you may add a section for Emulator Settings.

The following example is for the JollyCV core:

[jollycv]
;0 = TeaTime, 1 = SYoung
palette = 0

;N = Resampler Quality (0-10)
rsqual = 3

;0 = NTSC, 1 = PAL
region = 0

Cheats
------
When a core supports cheats, the cheat file must be named the same as the
game, but with a file extension of ".json". The file must be located in the
cheats directory for the core, for example:
  ~/.local/share/jollygood/cheats/corename/gamename.json

The file must be formatted as such:

{"cheats":[
  {"codes":["CHEAT001"], "enabled":true, "desc":"Single-code Cheat"},
  {"codes":["CHEAT002"], "enabled":false, "desc":"Disabled Single-code Cheat"},
  {"codes":["CHEAT003", "CHEAT004"], "enabled":true, "desc":"Multi-code Cheat"},
//  {"codes":["CHEAT005"], "enabled":true, "desc":"Commented Cheat"},
  {"codes":["CHEAT006"], "enabled":true, "desc":"Final Cheat has no comma"}
]}

The format for the cheat codes is different for each system, and some systems
support multiple types of codes. All codes are represented as JSON strings.
